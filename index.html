    <h3>What is it?</h3>

    <p>The Athletica Workout Reserve allows you to track your performance relative to your maximum. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>100%</strong>: It means you are fresh and at the start of your activity.</li>
        <li><strong>0%</strong>: It means you hit a personal best.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the example below, the Garmin watch indicates that still 22.9% remain until you reach your best performance. </p>
