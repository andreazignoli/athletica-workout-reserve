## What is Workout Reserve?

The Workout Reserve provides a **real-time performance metric** that answers a critical question during training: *"How much do I have left in the tank?"*

- **100%** means you're fresh and at the start of your activity
- **0%** means you've reached a personal best performance for that duration

By analyzing your past performance data, Workout Reserve provides real-time insights into how much effort you can sustain, facilitating more informed training decisions and better management of training loads.
