In March 2024, Andrea Zignoli published a blog post titled "A model that can evaluate the maximal mean power during exercise?" on his personal website. In this post, he discusses a study by Spragg et al. (2023) that examines how prior work intensity affects the power-duration relationship in professional cyclists. The study found that higher prior work intensity leads to a downward shift in the power-duration curve, indicating reduced performance capacity.

Zignoli connects these findings to the Athletica Workout Reserve (WR), a tool designed to monitor fluctuations in an athlete's maximal mean power during exercise. The WR operates on a straightforward principle: it tracks the rolling average of power output and compares it to historical maximums. When the WR reaches 0%, it signifies that the current rolling average matches the historical peak, indicating full utilization of the athlete's capacity.

This concept is versatile and can be applied to various endurance activities beyond cycling, such as running, by analyzing speed profiles. Additionally, Athletica has developed a real-time Garmin application that implements the WR concept, providing athletes with immediate feedback on their performance relative to their historical bests.
