On 9th April, 2024, Enrico Zanoncello of VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizanè crossed the finish line first in the opening stage of Il Giro d’Abruzzo Crédit Agricole, clinching the prestigious Maglia Azzurra. This achievement placed him at the forefront of the general classification after the 160 km route from Vasto to Pescara.
In a display of exceptional endurance, Enrico completed the course in 3 hours, 38 minutes, and 41 seconds, maintaining an average speed of 43.9 km/h. The race concluded with a closely contested sprint, with Enrico edging out Matteo Malucelli of JCL Team Ukyo and Manuel Peñalver of Team Polti Kometa.

Generously, Enrico and the VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizanè shared their race data with us, allowing a unique insight into the application of our latest Athletica feature: the Workout Reserve™. This tool analyzes rolling mean power output to indicate how close an athlete is to their historical maximum power at any moment during a race. We imported Enrico’s data into Athletica to construct his power profile, built off 21 robust and well-balanced training sessions.
